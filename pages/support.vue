            <h3>How We Use Donations</h3>
            <p class="mt-8">
              Funding for this project will be used primarily for app
              development and marketing to achieve the high adoption necessary
              for effectiveness. In terms of product development, funds will be
              used to support volunteers who are experiencing financial hardship
              and who require support to be able to continue working on app
              development, beta testing, and technical support; this would
              ensure more dedicated hours spent by developers on this project,
              resulting in higher-quality work being produced as soon as
              possible.
